# House Rent App

A simple web application to facilitate the renting of houses and apartments. This application allows users to browse, filter, and rent houses online. It provides both a front-end interface for users to explore available properties and a back-end for managing listings and rental processes.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Property Listings**: Browse available houses for rent with details like location, price, amenities, and photos.
- **Property Filters**: Filter properties based on criteria such as price range, location, and number of rooms.
- **Owner Panel**: Property owners can add, edit, and delete their rental listings.
- **Booking & Inquiries**: Users can inquire about properties or directly book them online.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can manage users, properties, and handle the rental transactions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (or any relevant framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (or another preferred database)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Deployment**: Heroku, AWS, or any cloud platform
- **Styling**: CSS/SASS, Bootstrap or Material UI
